Singapore Toto Probability Visualizer (STPV)

Hi, i happen to have an urge to create a website to simulate lottery probability 
Here i created a HTML page completely entirely out with Grok AI.
I wanted for people to realise the chance for someone to win a "Jackpot" is seamingly impossible probably in 10 times of our life time.
I am pretty sure the coding behind is abit buggy, as it may probably not function as what a typicial TOTO would.
I have zero knowledge on how to make a HTML so there will be bugs for sure.

For those who found any issue, do please comment on somewhere in git where i can fix. If you can fix it that would be amazing!

As an artist, i do drawings and 3D modeling for fun.
